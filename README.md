# Watcher of Friends Online

If you want to see, who of your friends is online in VK, but you don't want to use VK (for some reason) this script will help you! To use this script you need to authorize via your VK login and password. 

# How to Install

Python 3 should be already installed. Then use pip (or pip3 if there is a conflict with old Python 2 setup) to install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt # alternatively try pip3
```

Remember, it is recommended to use [virtualenv/venv](https://devman.org/encyclopedia/pip/pip_virtualenv/) for better isolation.
